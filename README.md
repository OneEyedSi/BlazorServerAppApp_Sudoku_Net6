Sudoku Blazor Server App
========================
Simon Elms, 6 Dec 2022

A Blazor Server app, written in .NET 6, that provides a grid for the user to play Sudoku on.  It doesn't solve the Sudoku game for the user.  Instead, it allows the user to enter the initial values, then solve the game themselves by manually entering values in each grid square.
